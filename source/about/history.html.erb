Newmark Grubb Central America was founded in 2002 as a real estate consulting company. Newmark Grubb Central America goes far beyond being just a real estate brokerage firm. Our experience has taught us to focus not only on the present features of the business, but also on the creation of a long term relationship with our customers.
