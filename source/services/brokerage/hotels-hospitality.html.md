Newmark Grubb Central America is a leader in the Hospitality sector. Our specialists have diverse backgrounds in lodging brokerage, operations, consulting, development and finance. We assist clients with the sale or purchase of hotels and provide site selection analysis, construction and property management services.
The process begins with a complete market analysis that is the foundation of a comprehensive, flexible marketing plan. Next, a development plan is formulated and monitored. During the entire process, communication is key. We realize that transaction negotiations are often complex and conducted under stressful circumstances and compressed timeframes. Our main objective is to provide the best results for our clients and, thus, build lasting relationships.
