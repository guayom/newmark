Since the early 1980s, Newmark Grubb Global has pioneered the use of computerized transaction management. Since 1999, REALTrac™ Online has been completely Web-based. The system tracks, manages and reports on thousands of ongoing transactions for Newmark Grubb offices, their agents, and corporate and institutional clients. REALTrac™ Online also acts as a “virtual” real estate department, managing portfolios and transactions and providing comprehensive reports on all developments for ongoing acquisition and disposition assignments. The software also features project management and collaboration tools which help accelerate transaction cycle times. Currently, more than 3,500 Newmark Grubb Global agents and 6,000 clients rely on REALTrac™ Online to facilitate their business objectives.
